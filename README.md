<H1 ALIGN =CENTER> Installation of Rust and Cargo Tool and Setting up Rust in VS Code Environment </H1>  

## AIM:  
To install Rust and Cargo tools and set up Rust in Visual Studio Code environment.  

## EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED:  
- Hardware – PCs  
- Software – Visual Studio Code (Version 1.104.0)  
- Rust Installation  
- Cargo Toolchain  

## RELATED THEORETICAL CONCEPT:  

*Rust:*  
Rust is a modern systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. It ensures memory safety without a garbage collector and provides powerful features like pattern matching, ownership, and concurrency handling.  

*Cargo:*  
Cargo is Rust’s package manager and build system. It helps in managing dependencies, building packages, testing code, and running projects.  

*Need for Cargo in VS Code:*  
- Smooth integration of Rust projects into VS Code.  
- Simplifies the build, run, and debugging process.  
- Helps in managing dependencies and external crates.  
- Improves developer productivity with extensions.  

## ALGORITHM:  
STEP 1: Install **rustup-init.exe** from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and run the file. <BR>  
STEP 2: Complete the installation process. <BR>  
STEP 3: Update Rust and Cargo to the latest version. <BR>  
STEP 4: Check the version of Rust and Cargo. <BR>  
STEP 5: Install the Build Tools for Visual Studio Code from [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) and run the exe file. <BR>  
STEP 6: In the Visual Studio Installer, select **Desktop development with C++** and install. <BR>  
STEP 7: Install all the necessary Rust extensions in Visual Studio Code. <BR>  
STEP 8: Run a simple *Hello World* program to test if Rust works in VS Code. <BR>  

## PROGRAM:  
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Rust in VS Code!");
}
```

## RESULT:

Thus we have successfully installed Rust and Cargo tool and setup Rust to work in Visual Studio Code.
